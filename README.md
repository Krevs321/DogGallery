# Dogs Gallery

This is Vue app where you can see the friendliest companions that another human can have - dogs. 

No two dogs are the same and of course each dog has it's breed. In the app you can see all the different breeds with an image of that breed.
You can click on the button View images to see more images of that specifi breed.

To run the app, all I want you to do is, to run this command in your terminal -> npm run dev. This is create a localhost link that you can click and open the website.
